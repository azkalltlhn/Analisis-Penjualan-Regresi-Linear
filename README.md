# Sales Analysis Using Linear Regression 2

# Introduction
The advancement of technology significantly impacts sales, enabling businesses to leverage big data for deeper insights. Companies can analyze customer behavior, optimize marketing strategies, and improve operational efficiency using data-driven approaches. This project utilizes Linear Regression to identify key factors affecting sales performance and predict future trends.

# Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and patterns in sales data.
3. Linear Regression Model: Building predictive models to forecast future sales.
4. Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and other key metrics.

# Dataset
The dataset contains sales transaction records from an e-commerce business, providing insights into various attributes such as product descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and customer locations.

# Installation and Usage
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azkalltlhn/Gradient_Boosting_Classifier.git

2. **Install the required dependencies::**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

3. Open Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Load the BIGDATA_2.ipynb file and run all cells.

# Results and Evaluation
The model evaluates sales trends and predicts revenue based on historical data. Key findings include:
1. Strong correlation between product pricing and sales volume.
2. Seasonal variations affecting customer purchasing behavior.
3. Predictive accuracy assessed using MSE and R-squared scores.

# Conclusion
By leveraging Linear Regression, businesses can make data-driven decisions, optimize inventory, and enhance marketing strategies. This project provides a foundation for further improvements in predictive analytics for sales forecasting.
